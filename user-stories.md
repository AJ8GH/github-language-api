# User stories

```
As a user,
I want to see some information in the web page,
So that I know what the app does and how to use it

As a user,
I want to be able to enter a github user name,
So that I can find the favourite languages of any user

As a user,
I want to the favourite language to be displayed,
So that I can easily see which language a user prefers

As a user,
I want to see a list of all the languages with a number of repositories,
So that I can analyse how much they have used other languages

As a user,
I want the app to have an attractive interface,
So that it is a pleasure to use and look at
