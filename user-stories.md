# User stories

```
As a user,
I want to see some information in the web page,
So that I know what the app does and how to use it

As a user,
I want to be able to enter a github user name,
So that I can find the favourite languages of any user

As a user,
I want the favourite language to be displayed,
So that I can easily see which language a user prefers

As a user,
I want to see a list of all languages used and how many repositories for each,
So that I can analyse how much they have used other languages

As a user,
I want the app to have an attractive interface,
So that it is a pleasure to use and look at

As a user,
I want to see a helpful message if I forget to enter a username or if the user doesn't exist,
So that I know what has gone wrong and how to fix it

As a user,
I want null language repositories to be ignored,
Do that the results are focused on programming languages only

As a user,
I want to see a helpful message when a GH user has not committed any code,
So that I know why there are no results.
